Azure disk:  when we deployed a VM, a disk will created with 127GiB at OS level, where we can store our data.

Azure disks are block level storage, these are managed by azure.

Disk can created while launching the vm or after creation of VM.

We can attach the Disk to VM also

Vm will get temporary disk also, the size of temporary disk is depends on size of the VM.


To attach a data disk to VM:
	1.	In portal-go to VM-select disks under settings
	2.	Click on attach data disk
	3.	Give the details such as name, storage type, size
	4.	After the data disk created, the VM will updated.
	5.	Login to the VM-go to server manager-now we need to mount the volume to disk
	6.	Click on file and storage services-disks-you can see the count of disks- right click on which you created in the portal, initialise it.
	7.	Once it was initialized, click on create new volume and give details of that disk.

When you stopped or deallocated the VM from azure portal
	1.	The data files or folders in temporary disk will get deleted.
	2.	But the data in c drive and data disk which one we attached, they will not delete 
	3.	If the VM ip is static the ip will not change.
	4.	The underlying physical infrastructure of VM might be same or not.

Disk Snapshot:  snapshot is a read only copy of virtual hard disk. We can take a snapshot of OS level disk or data disk to use it as a backup. 

To create a snapshot of Data Disk:
	1.	Go to  VM-settings-disk
	2.	Select the data disk what we created for VM 
	3.	Click on “create snapshot”
	4.	Give details such as RG, name of the disk.
	5.	Click on create.
	6.	Once you created, go to the resource, it was a separate resource.
	7.	So open that snapshot, in snapshot overview page, we can see option called “create disk”
	8.	So from the created snapshot, we can create a data disk.
	9.	Click on create disk, provide details.
	10.	Now we have new data disk from the disk snapshot from the existed data disk of the VM.
	11.	Go to any other VM, settings- disks
	12.	Click on “attach an existing disk” give name and apply.
	13.	Now login to VM, you will see the volume called “data” what we created earlier. Whatever file are available in data disk , we can see same file in another VM of data volume. Because same disk we attached through snapshot.

We can detach the existing disk from the VM and attach it to a new another VM.


Disk Encryption: when we created a disk.  It’s stored in storage unit of azure data centre.

For security purpose, to protect our disk from malicious users, we need to encrypt the disk.

For encryption of disk, we can encrypt with the help of key vault.

By default the OS level disk and data disk are encrypted using SSE with PMK(server side encryption with platform managed keys) by Azure.


But if customer wants to encrypt them using their own keys that means customer managed key, then we can use the Key vault for our own keys 

The purge protection and soft enables should be enabled while creating the key vault.

To create the key in key vault:
 Go to key vault-keys-click on create keys-give name, size, and type-create.

To create the disk encryption set:
Search for disk encryption set-give name, key vault-key details-and create.

To attaché CMK as encryption for VM disk, first we need to deattach the disk which we attached.

So, go to vm-settings-disk, deattach  and apply.
And now go to disk, in the encryption, select the CMK with key vault details.
